# SweetGit
## What is this
**SweetGit** is another of my experiments to learn something new quick in the funny way.

The project is generating a widget depending on given GitHub username.
Then you can see the user profile photo, username, full name, count of followers, following and stars received on public repositories.

SweetGit is using the GitHub API for doing it's work. And... lets see what other things we have: 

Languages and technologies:
- JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS
- HTML5, CSS3

Cool things to make it kind of nice, kind of work properly:
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
- [Animate contents](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)
- [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip)
- [FileSaver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)
