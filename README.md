# SweetGit
Have you ever wanted a widget for your site/blog showing your GitHub profile in a sweet way?

## What is this?
**SweetGit** is another of my experiments to learn something new quickly and in the funny way.

The project is generating a widget depending on given GitHub username.
Then you can see the user profile photo, username, full name, count of followers, following and stars received on public repositories.

**SweetGit** is using the GitHub API for doing it's work. And... lets see what other things we have: 

Languages and technologies:
- JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS
- HTML5, CSS3

Cool things to make it kind of nice, kind of work properly:
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
- [Animate contents](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)
- [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip)
- [FileSaver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js)

More special thanks:
- [That I love you](https://www.dafont.com/that-i-love-you.font) font
- the [@undefined](https://github.com/undefined) user

## How this thing works?
Very simple. If you give to **SweetGit** a valid username, it will make you a sweet widget!
After that you can see the generated html code and take it. Or download zip file with all the styles, fonts and the html code for the look as I made (it's not the best, thought). You can style it too... if you dare.

## Why this thing exists?
**SweetGit** is another prove that you can learn while you do the things you love. Yeah, I don't love CSS, but that's not the point.

## Who worked on this?
- Design part - [@mdamyanova](https://github.com/mdamyanova) - obviously, and not the 'good' obviously
- Logic part - [@mdamyanova](https://github.com/mdamyanova) - with **a lots of** Google searches

## Who uses this?
- [ella](https://mdamyanova.github.io)

## What's not ready yet?
**SweetGit** is still a baby. 
- It needs to dynamically load information, not a static one. We'll make that someday.
- The counting of stars is not completed. If you have more stars, it's not working properly. We'll fix that.
- Styling is not as cool as I imagined it. It needs more beautiful look.

## Does this thing has a license?
Actually, it does. The really small project is under [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Okay, it's nice.
I knew it! Here's a sweety! Thanks for coming! ü•êüçØüç≠üç¨
